"""Kinotour, a touring operator in Varsinais-Suomi. Stdlib only.

One request. `kinotour.fi/varaa-liput-elokuvatapahtumiin/` renders the whole programme as
one card per screening, read 2026-09-29 (the Events Manager table it replaced was read
until that day):

    <article class="kt-event" data-city="Naantali" data-type="indoor">
      <h3>Hetki ennen valoa</h3>
      <p class="kt-event-date"><time datetime="2026-10-04T13:30:00+03:00">4.10.2026 · klo 13.30</time></p>
      <p class="kt-location">Naantali · Kristoffer-sali</p>
      <p class="kt-meta">87 min · K7</p>
      <div class="kt-event-action"><strong>11,00 € <small>/ hlö</small></strong>
        <button class="kt-book" data-event="{...}">Varaa liput</button></div>
    </article>

What shapes the parser:

- **A town this repository does not declare is counted and named, never dropped in
  silence and never a failure.** A touring operator visits a new town as a matter of
  course, so failing the site on one would turn the routine case into breakage. The run
  log carries a line per run until someone adds the town to `SITES`, which is the same
  shape CLAUDE.md gives `reads`.
- **The venue is keyed on the town, `data-city`**, not the hall: the hall changes while
  the tour keeps coming back to the town.
- **The start is the `<time>` element's own instant**, and the printed "4.10.2026 · klo
  13.30" beside it has to agree; a card where they differ fails the site rather than
  publishing a screening at a guessed time.
- **The rating and the price come off the card.** `K7` from "87 min · K7", and one
  amount per card, the screening's own. A card with no amount, or more than one,
  publishes none; the pensioners' and students' euro off at the till is a condition, not
  the ticket's price. The runtime is not read: on 2026-09-29 all three cards printed
  87 min, Rakkautta & Virtahepoja included, which runs 102 everywhere else.
- **The booking is a button on this page**, with no link of its own, so every screening
  links to the listing it was read from. Nothing behind the button is requested.
- **No poster, runtime, genre or language is read.** The shared enrichment fills what
  it can.

**Zero cards fails the site**, and so do cards that all land in undeclared towns: a town
key that stopped reading produces the same page, so it is no evidence the declared towns
are empty. No empty programme has been seen here, so there is no evidence of what one
looks like: `common.EmptyProgramme` is for the case where that evidence is in hand.

# A town with no card is known empty, not unread, once the page filed a card under some

# operator's whole published programme in one request, so a town it does not mention has
# nothing on. An undeclared card may be a declared town's screening under a place that
# reads differently, so while one is on the page `fetch_site` reports only the towns with
# cards, as eTiketti, Nexxo and Alatalo do, and an empty town keeps its previous file.
# `run.py` then publishes a fresh empty file for that venue instead of ageing its last
# visit, which is the case its own comment names: "a touring cinema's town is empty
# between visits". A page with no card under any declared town never reaches that loop,
# because `fetch_site` raises first: cards that all land in undeclared towns are also what
# a town key that stopped reading produces.
